.TH DELHOSTS 3PVM "30 August, 1993" "" "PVM Version 3.4"
.SH NAME
pvm_delhosts \- Deletes hosts from the virtual machine.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
C	int info = pvm_delhosts( char **hosts, int nhost, int *infos )
.br

Fortran	call pvmfdelhost( host, info )
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.IP hosts 0.8i
An array of pointers to character strings
containing the names of the machines to be deleted.
.br
.IP nhost
Integer specifying the number of hosts to be deleted.
.br
.IP infos
Integer array of length
.I nhost
which contains the
status code returned by the routine for the individual hosts.
Values less than zero indicate an error.
.br
.IP host
Character string containing the name of the machine to be deleted.
.br
.IP info
Integer status code returned by the routine.
Values less than nhost indicate partial failure,
values less than 1 indicate total failure.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The routine
.I pvm_delhosts
deletes the computers pointed to in
.I hosts
from the existing configuration of computers making up the virtual
machine.
All PVM processes and the pvmd running on these computers are
killed as the computer is deleted.
If pvm_delhosts is successful,
.I info
will be
.I nhost.
Partial success is indicated by 1<= info < nhost,
and total failure by info < 1.
The array
.I infos
can be checked to determine which host
caused the error.
.PP
The Fortran routine
.I pvmfdelhost
deletes a single host from
the configuration with each call.
.PP
If a host fails, the PVM system will continue to function and will
automatically delete this host from the virtual machine.
An application can be notified of a host failure by calling
pvm_notify.
It is still the responsibility of the
application developer to make his application tolerant of host failure.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
C:
	static char *hosts[] = {
		"sparky",
		"thud.cs.utk.edu",
	};
	int status[2];
	info = pvm_delhosts( hosts, 2, status );
.sp
Fortran:
	CALL PVMFDELHOST( 'azure', INFO )

.SH ERRORS
These error conditions can be returned by
.I pvm_delhosts
.IP PvmBadParam
giving an invalid argument value.
.IP PvmSysErr
local pvmd not responding.
