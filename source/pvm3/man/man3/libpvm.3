.SH NAME
libpvm3.a, libfpvm3.a \- PVM C and Fortran programming libraries

.SH DESCRIPTION

All PVM applications must be linked with the libpvm library to allow them
to communicate with other entities in the PVM system.
The base library (libpvm3.a) is
written in C and
directly supports C and C++ applications.
The Fortran library (libfpvm3.a) consists of wrapper functions to
convert Fortran calling sequences to C.

Applications written in C
must be linked with at least the base PVM library, libpvm3.a.
Fortran applications must be linked with both libfpvm3.a and libpvm3.a.
On some operating systems,
PVM programs must be linked with
other vendor-provided libraries
(containing for example, socket or XDR functions).

Programs that use group functions
must also be linked with libgpvm3.a.

.SH SUBROUTINES

.SH ERRORS
On success, most libpvm functions return the constant PvmOk.
The following error conditions can be returned by libpvm functions:

.IP PvmAlready
The requested operation requires exclusive access,
and another was already in progress.
.IP PvmBadMsg
The received messages has a data format native to another machine,
which cannot be decoded by libpvm.
.IP PvmBadParam
A bad parameter was passed to the function.
.IP PvmBadVersion
Two PVM components (pvmd and task, two pvmds or two tasks) have
incompatible protocol versions and cannot interoperate.
Version mismatch
.IP PvmCantStart
A pvmd could not be started on the local host,
or a slave pvmd could not be started on a remote host.
.IP PvmDSysErr
Some internal mechanism in the pvmd failed during the requested operation.
.IP PvmDupEntry
The class server already has an entry matching the insert request.
[In Version 3.4: Relaced by PvmExists]
.IP PvmDupGroup
The task has already a member of the group it attempted to join.
.IP PvmDupHost
An attempt was made to add the same host to a virtual machine more than
once,
or to add a host already a member of another virtual machine owned by
the same user.
.IP PvmDenied
Operation is refused due to locking, permissions, etc.
.IP PvmExists
There is already an entry matching the insert request.
.IP PvmHostFail
A foreign host in the virtual machine failed during the requested operation.
.IP PvmMismatch
A parameter does not match a corresponding one.
.IP PvmNoBuf
There is no current message buffer to pack or unpack.
.IP PvmNoData
The end of a message buffer was reached while trying to unpack data.
.IP PvmNoEntry
The class server has no entry matching the lookup request.
.br
[In Version 3.4: Relaced by PvmNotFound]
.IP PvmNoFile
The named executable does not exist.
.IP PvmNoGroup
The named group does not exist.
.IP PvmNoHost
There is no host in the virtual machine with the given name,
or the name could not be resolved to an address.
.IP PvmNoInst
The named group has no member with this instance.
.IP PvmNoMem
Malloc failed to get memory for libpvm.
.IP PvmNoParent
This task has no parent task.
.IP PvmNoSuchBuf
There is no message buffer with the given buffer handle.
.IP PvmNoTask
No task exists with the given tid.
.IP PvmNotFound
No entry matching the lookup request was found.
.IP PvmNotImpl
This libpvm function or option is not implemented.
.IP PvmNotInGroup
The named group has no such member task.
.IP PvmNullGroup
A null group name was passed to a function.
.IP PvmOutOfRes
The requested operation could not be completed due to lack of resources.
.IP PvmOverflow
A value is too large to be packed or unpacked.
.IP PvmSysErr
Libpvm could not contact a pvmd on the local host,
or the pvmd failed during an operation.
