.SH PARAMETERS
.IP name 0.8i

.IP index 0.8i
The class index, >= 0 or -1 for first available.
.IP data 0.8i
Data to store in the <name, index> entry.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The master pvmd maintains a simple database,
which can be used to store values such as tids and make them
accessible anywhere within a virtual
machine.
This is useful when building an application such as the group
server,
which must advertise its task id
so clients can register send messages to register.

The database stores integer data,
indexed by <name, index> pairs.
The name may be any null-terminated string
and the index any non-negative integer.
Database entries are grouped by name into classes;
index may be specified as -1 to store or retrieve the first available
instance in a class.

These functions are not part of the group library,
but are the underlying mechanism used to implement it.

\fIpvm_insert\fR stores data at the given index.
If index is -1,
the data is stored at the first available index in the named class,
starting at 0.

.SH ERRORS
If successful,
pvm_insert returns the index at which the data was stored,
otherwise it returns a negative result.
The following error conditions can be returned:
.IP PvmBadParam
giving an invalid argument value.
.IP PvmDupEntry
the requested <name, index> pair is already in use.
