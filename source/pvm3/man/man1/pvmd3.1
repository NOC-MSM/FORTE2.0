.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pvmd3
is a daemon process which coordinates unix hosts
in a virtual machine.
One \fIpvmd3\fR must run on each host in the group.
They provide the communication and process control functions
needed by the user's PVM processes.
The daemon can be started manually with a host file argument
that will automatically start the remote pvmds.
The local and remote pvmds can also be started from the PVM console
program \fIpvm\fR.

The name of the daemon executable is \fIpvmd3\fR.
It is usually started by a shell script, \fI$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmd\fR.

[v3.4 and later]
Before running pvmd3,
pvmd
sources any commands in \fI$HOME/.pvmprofile\fR
if this file exists.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options may be specified on the command line when
starting the master pvmd or PVM console:
.TP 8
-d\fImask\fR
Set pvmd debug mask.
Used to debug the pvmd or libpvm (not intended to be used to debug
application programs).
\fIMask\fR is the \fIsum\fR of the following bits
and
can be specified in hexadecimal (0x...), octal (0...) or decimal:

.TP 8
-n\fIname\fR
Specify an alternate hostname for the master pvmd to use.
Useful when \fIgethostname()\fR returns a name not assigned to any
network interface.
.PP

The following options are used by the master pvmd when starting slaves
and are only of interest to someone writing a \fIhoster\fR.
Don't just go using them, now.
.TP
-s
Start pvmd in slave mode.
Hostfile cannot be used,
five additional parameters must be supplied:
master pvmd index,
master IP,
master MTU,
slave pvmd index,
and
slave IP.
.TP
-S
Same as -s,
but slave pvmd doesn't wait for its \fIstdin\fR to be closed
after printing its parameters.
Used for manual startup.
.TP
-f
Slave doesn't fork after configuration (useful if the slave is
to be controlled or monitored by some process).
.PP

.SH HOST FILE FORMAT
Each host in the virtual machine must have an entry in the host
file.
Lines beginning with a splat ( # ), optionally preceded by whitespace,
are ignored.

A simple host file might look like:

	# my first host file
.br
	thud
.br
	fred
.br
	wilma
.br
	barney
.br
	betty

This specifies the names of five hosts to be configured in the virtual machine.

The master \fIpvmd\fR for a group is started by hand on the localhost,
and it starts slaves on each of the remaining hosts
using the \fIrsh\fR or \fIrexec\fR command.
The master host may appear on any line of the host file.
Host names cannot be numeric (IP) addresses,
because they are passed to rsh and rexec(),
which usually don't accept addresses.

The simple format above works fine if you have the same login name
on all five machines and the name of the master host in your .rhosts
files on the other four.

There are several host file options available:
.RS
.TP 10
lo=NAME
Specifies an alternate login name (NAME) to use.

.TP
so=pw
This is necessary when the remote host cannot trust the master.
Causes the master pvmd to prompt for a password for the remote host
in the tty of the pvmd (note you can't start the master using the
console or background it when using this option) you will see:
.br
	Password (honk.cs.utk.edu:manchek):
.br
you should type your password for the remote host.  The startup
will then continue as normal.

.TP
dx=FILE
Specifies the path of the pvmd executable.
FILE may be a simple filename, an absolute pathname,
or a path relative to the user's home directory on the remote host.
This is mainly useful to aid in debugging new versions of PVM,
but may have other uses.

.TP
ep=PATH
Specifies a path for the \fIpvmd\fR to search for executable
program components when spawning a new process.
The path may have multiple elements, separated by colons ( : ).

.TP
wd=PATH
Specifies a working directory in which all spawned
tasks on this host will execute.

.TP
sp=VALUE
Specifies the relative computational speed of this host
compared to other hosts in the configuration.
VALUE is an integer in the range [1 - 1000000]

.TP
bx=PATH
Specifies the debugger program path.
Note: the environment variable PVM_DEBUGGER can also be set.

.TP
ip=NAME
Specifies an alternate IP address to use for the host.
As with host names (when ip= is not used),
the address must be a host name, not a numeric address, because it is passed
to rsh and rexec().
This option allows one to pick a specific network interface for a machine
without using the interface's name.
It can also be used to create a virtual machine using symbolic (instead of actual)
host names.

.TP
so=ms
Rarely used.
Causes the master pvmd to request user to manually
perform the startup of a pvmd on a slave host when rsh and rexec
network services are disabled but IP connectivity exists.
See section "MANUAL STARTUP".

.TP
id=VMID
A new feature in PVM 3.4.4 is the concept of a "Virtual Machine ID".
You can now set the VMID to an arbitrary string and this will
distinguish and allow multiple virtual machines to run on the same
set of hosts under the same userid.  (This feature was originally
introduced by SGI in their commercial PVM product, and has now been
generalized for the public PVM system.)  This feature seems to be
something that people often want, and the "id=" hostfile option
(or $PVM_VMID environment variable) is the cleanest
way to provide this functionality, rather than overloading the
SHAREDTMP compiler flag and other internals.
.sp
*** Make Sure *** that you appropriately set the $PVM_VMID environment
variable in any shells from which PVM application tasks or the "pvm"
console will be run, or else they won't know
.I which
virtual machine to attach to!
.sp
By default, all hosts which are added to the virtual machine
will inherit the same VMID.  If hosts are added to the virtual machine
which are running older versions of PVM (prior to 3.4.4), then the
VMID will be ignored for those hosts, and hence these machines can
only be added to one virtual machine for the given user.  The VMID
need not be consistent on every host in a virtual machine (although
this is not necessarily advisable).
.RE
.PP

A dollar sign ( $ ) in an option introduces a variable name,
for example \fI$PVM_ARCH\fR.
Names are expanded from environment variables by each pvmd.

Each of the flags above has a default value.  These are:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 8
lo
The loginname on the master host.
.TP 8
so
Nothing
.TP 8
dx
$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmd (or environment variable PVM_DPATH)
.TP 8
ep
$HOME/pvm3/bin/$PVM_ARCH:$PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH
.TP 8
wd
$HOME
.TP 8
sp
1000
.TP 8
bx
$PVM_ROOT/lib/debugger
.PD
.RE
.PP

You can change these by adding a line with a star ( * ) in the
first field followed by the options, for example:

	* lo=afriend so=pw

This sets new default values for 'lo' and 'so' for the remainder
of the host file, or until the next '*' line.
Options set on the last '*' line also apply to hosts added dynamically
using \fIpvm_addhosts()\fR.

Host options can be set without starting the hosts automatically.
Information on host file lines beginning with '&' is stored,
but the hosts are not started until added using \fIpvm_addhosts()\fR.

Example host file:
.nf
	# host file for testing on various platforms
	fonebone
	refuge
	# installed in /usr/local here
	sigi.cs            dx=/usr/local/pvm3/lib/pvmd
	# borrowed accts, "guest", don't trust fonebone
	*                  lo=guest  so=pw
	sn666.jrandom.com
	cubie.misc.edu
	# really painful one, must start it by hand and share a homedir
	& igor.firewall.com  lo=guest2  so=ms  ep=bob/pvm3/bin/$PVM_ARCH
.fi

.SH MANUAL STARTUP
When adding a host with this option set you will see on the tty of the pvmd:
.nf
.\"	[t80040000] ready   Fri Aug 27 18:47:47 1993
	*** Manual startup ***
	Login to "honk" and type:
	$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmd -S -d0 -nhonk 1 80a9ca95:0cb6 4096 2 80a95c43:0000
	Type response:
.fi

after typing the given command on host \fIhonk\fR, you should see a line like:
.nf
	ddpro<2312> arch<ALPHA> ip<80a95c43:0a8e> mtu<4096>
.fi

type this line on the tty of the master pvmd.
You should then see:
.nf
	Thanks
.fi

and the two pvmds should be able to communicate.

Note you can't start the master using the
console or background it when using this option.

.SH OVERLOADING HOSTS

You can force PVM to overload a host (start more than one pvmd on it)
by putting a '$' before the host name in the host file.
This is not recommended unless you know what you're doing and have
a good reason for it.
You must build the PVM source with option OVERLOADHOST defined for it to work.

You may also need to use the ip= hostfile option to define several names
with the same IP address.
If two or more hosts in a PVM have the same name,
they cannot be identified uniquely.

.SH STOPPING PVMD3
.\"When pvmd3 starts up it prints the single line:
.\"[t800xxxxxxx] ready
.\".PP
The preferred method of stopping all the pvmds is to give the
\fIhalt\fR command in the PVM console. This kills all PVM tasks,
all the remote daemons, the local daemon, and finally the console itself.
If the master pvmd is killed manually it should be sent a SIGTERM signal
to allow it to kill the remote pvmds and clean up various files.
.PP
The pvmd can be killed in a manner that leaves the file
/tmp/pvmd.\fIuid\fR behind on one or more hosts.
\fIUid\fR is the numeric user ID (from /etc/passwd) of the user.
This will prevent PVM from restarting on that host.
Deletion of this file will fix this problem:

.nf
    rm `( grep $user /etc/passwd || ypmatch $user passwd )
         | awk -F: '{print "/tmp/pvmd."$3; exit}'` 
.fi
