.SH SYNOPSIS

.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pvm
is a stand alone PVM task which allows the user to interactively
query and modify the virtual machine.
The console can be started and stopped multiple times on any of
the hosts in the virtual machine without affecting PVM or any
applications that may be running.
.PP
When started \fIpvm\fR determines if PVM is already running
and if not automatically executes pvmd3 on this host,
passing pvmd3 the command line options and host file.
Thus PVM need not be running to start the console.
Once started the console prints the prompt:
.br
	pvm>

.I pvm
reads $HOME/.pvmrc before reading commands from the tty,
so it can be used to customize the console environment,
for example:
.nf
    alias ? help
    alias j jobs
    setenv PVM_EXPORT DISPLAY
    # print my id
    echo new pvm shell
    id
.fi
