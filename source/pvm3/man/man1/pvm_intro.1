.SH NAME
PVM, pvm_intro \- Parallel Virtual Machine System Version 3
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I PVM
is a software system that enables a collection of heterogeneous
computers to be used as a coherent and flexible concurrent computational
resource.

The individual computers may be shared- or local-memory multiprocessors,
vector supercomputers, specialized graphics engines, or scalar
workstations, that may be interconnected by a variety of networks,
such as ethernet, FDDI.

User programs written in C, C++ or Fortran access PVM through library
routines (\fIlibpvm3.a\fR and \fIlibfpvm3.a\fR).

Daemon programs (\fIpvmd3\fR) provide communication and process control
between computers.

.\".SH INSTALLING

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables are read by PVM and may be set
in order to customize your PVM environment.
To set them,
you can add commands to your \fI.cshrc\fR or \fI.profile\fR
or equivalent shell startup file.
See the manual page for the shell you normally use for information
about how to do this.
You can also include an appropriate shell startup file stub to set
PVM environment variables and to add PVM directories to your
execution path.
Inert the matching stub file, pvm3/lib/cshrc.stub, pvm3/lib/kshrc.stub
or pvm3/lib/bashrc.stub, after your declaration of PVM_ROOT
in your shell startup file.

For \fIcsh\fR users:
Note that setting them in \fI.login\fR does not have the same effect.
The .login script file
is only read when you are actually logging in,
whereas .cshrc is read every time csh starts up.
PVM needs to have environment variables set when it starts a slave
pvmd with "rsh host pvmd ...",
so they must be set in .cshrc.

For those using a shell that doesn't always read a startup script
(e.g. \fIsh\fR, \fIksh\fR),
there is another way to set environment variables
for PVM.
Before running the PVM executables,
the \fIpvm\fR and \fIpvmd\fR startup scripts
source any commands in \fI$HOME/.pvmprofile\fR
if this file exists.

The following environment variables are supported by PVM 3.4.4:
.IP PVM_ROOT
The path where PVM libraries and system programs are installed,
for example /usr/local/pvm3 or $HOME/pvm3.
This variable must be set on each host where PVM is used in order
for PVM to function.
There is no default value.
.IP PVM_TMP
The path for PVM temporary files, such as the daemon socket file
pvmd.<uid> and the log file pvml.<uid>.
Use this environment variable to use a directory other than /tmp
(or C:\\TEMP on Win32),
or to introduce added security by using a protected subdirectory
in /tmp that is owned by your userid and cannot be easily corrupted.
.IP PVM_RSH
The path to the "rsh" program on your system, if different than
that defined in the $PVM_ROOT/conf/$PVM_ARCH.def configuration file.
This environment variable can also be used to replace "rsh" with "ssh"
for added security.
.IP PVM_PATH
The execution path to be searched for PVM programs on your system.
By default, PVM looks in $HOME/pvm3/bin/$PVM_ARCH and
$PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH for your PVM applications.
This environment variable does \fBnot\fR override the \fIep=\fR
host file option.
.IP PVM_WD
The working directory for spawned PVM programs on your system.
By default, PVM spawns your PVM applications in $HOME, but
for convenience in accessing data or input files using relative
path names, an alternate working directory can be specified.
This environment variable does \fBnot\fR override the \fIwd=\fR
host file option.
.IP PVM_EXPORT
Names of environment variables to export from a parent task
to children tasks through \fIpvm_spawn()\fR.
Multiple names must be separated by ':'.
If PVM_EXPORT is not set, no environment is exported.
.IP PVM_DEBUGGER
The debugger script to use when \fIpvm_spawn()\fR is called
with \fIPvmTaskDebug\fR set.
The default is $PVM_ROOT/lib/debugger.
.IP PVM_DPATH
The path of the pvmd startup script (default is $PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmd).
It is overridden by host file option \fIdx=\fR.

This variable is useful if you use a shell that doesn't automatically
execute a startup script (such as .cshrc) to allow setting PVM_ROOT
on slave (added) hosts.
If you set it to the absolute or relative path of the pvmd startup
script (for example /usr/local/pvm3/lib/pvmd or pvm3/lib/pvmd),
the script will automatically set PVM_ROOT.
Note that for this to work,
you must set it to run the pvmd script,
not the pvmd3 executable itself.
.IP PVM_WINDPATH
This variable serves the same purpose as the PVM_DPATH above,
but specifically for Win32 systems.  This second environment
variable allows for alternate specification of the path to
the pvmd3.exe daemon executable using appropriate DOS file path
syntax and environment variables
(e.g. %PVM_ROOT%\\lib\\WIN32\\pvmd3.exe).
.IP PVMHOSTFILE
Specifies the path to an optional host file to be used by default
when starting PVM.
This alleviates the need to manually pass a host file path argument
to the "pvm" console or "pvmd" script when starting PVM.
.IP PVMDLOGMAX
Sets the maximum length of the pvmd error log file.
Default value is the PVMDLOGMAX parameter in the source, 1 Mbyte.
.IP PVMDDEBUG
Sets the default pvmd debugging mask (as does the pvmd -d option).
Value can be in hexadecimal (0x...), octal (0...) or decimal.
Used to debug the pvmd (not intended to be used to debug
application programs).
.IP PVMTASKDEBUG
Sets the default libpvm debugging mask
(as does pvm_setopt(PvmDebugMask, x)).
Value can be in hexadecimal (0x...), octal (0...) or decimal.
Used to debug libpvm (not intended to be used to debug
application programs).
.IP PVMTASK
Sets additional flag bits for the pvm_spawn() library call.
Allows override at run time of flags compiled into the
pvm_spawn() calls in PVM application, e.g. to turn on
PvmTaskDebug for popping up child tasks in a debugger window.
.IP PVMBUFSIZE
Sets the size of the shared memory buffers used by libpvm and the pvmd.
The default value is 1048576.
If your program composes messages longer than this size,
you must increase it.
.IP PVM_VMID
A new feature in PVM 3.4.4 is the concept of a "Virtual Machine ID".
You can now set the PVM_VMID environment variable to an arbitrary
string (or use the "id=" option in a host file, see man page for pvmd3),
and this will distinguish and allow multiple virtual machines to run
on the same set of hosts under the same userid.  (This feature was
originally introduced by SGI in their commercial PVM product, and has
now been generalized for the public PVM system.)  This feature seems
to be something that people often want, and the PVM_VMID is the
cleanest way to provide this functionality, rather than overloading
the SHAREDTMP compiler flag and other internals.
.sp
Setting the PVM_VMID environment variable before starting PVM will
create an encapsulated virtual machine with the given VMID name.
By default, all other hosts which are added to this virtual machine
will inherit the same VMID.  If hosts are added to the virtual machine
which are running older versions of PVM (prior to 3.4.4), then the
VMID will be ignored for those hosts, and hence these machines can
only be added to one virtual machine for the given user.  The VMID
need not be consistent on every host in a virtual machine (although
this is not necessarily advisable), and the VMID can be set for
individual hosts using the "id=" host file option (see man page for
pvmd3).
.PP

The following environment variables are used by PVM internally.
With the exception of PVM_ARCH,
their values should not be modified.
This is for information only.
.IP PVM_ARCH
The PVM architecture name of the host on which it is set,
used to distinguish between
machines with different executable (a.out) formats.
Copies of a program for different architectures are installed
in parallel directories named for PVM architectures.
.IP PVMSOCK
Is passed from pvmd to spawned task, and gives the
address of the pvmd local socket.
.IP PVMEPID
Holds the expected process id of a spawned task exec'd by the pvmd.
This is a magic cookie used by the
task to identify itself when reconnecting to the pvmd,
in order to get the correct task slot.
.IP PVMTMASK
The libpvm trace mask,
passed from the pvmd to spawned tasks.
.IP PVMTRCBUF
The libpvm trace buffer size.
If specified determines the number of bytes of trace event message
buffer to be collected before sending to front-end tracer program.
.IP PVMTRCOPT
The libpvm trace option setting.
Determines the level of tracing to be performed on invocations of
PVM library calls.
.IP PVMINPLACEDELAY
Used to optimize sending of PvmDataInPlace messages on MPP systems.
.IP PVMKEY
PVM uses this value,
combined with the process id,
to generate shared-memory segment keys.
The default value is your numeric uid.
PVM automatically detects collisions when generating a key
and picks a new key,
so it should almost never need to be set explicitly.
