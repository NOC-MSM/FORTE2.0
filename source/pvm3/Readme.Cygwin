To install PVM 3.4.0 in the Cygwin environment:

1-	Install the Cygwin version b20.1 package
	(http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/)

2-	Install and configure the WRSHD-9X or WRSHD-NT package
	(http://www.uni-paderborn.de/cs/getin/download.htm)

3-	Choose suitable locations for /tmp and /etc. These could be real
	directories or mount points. See the Cygwin documentation.

4-	Create the passwd and group databases using Cygwin's mkpasswd and
	mkgroup utilities.

5-	Unzip the pvm3_4_0_Xcygwin.ZIP archive in the directory of your choice.
	This directory will be the PVM root directory.

6-	In the Control Panel, choose the System icon and select the environment
	tab. Add the following variables to the system variables (requires
	administraive privileges under NT):

Variable	Value
PVM_ARCH	Win32
PVM_ROOT	Windows path to the PVM root directory (e.g., D:\pvm3_4_0)
PVM_ROOT_U	Unix path to the PVM root directory, using / instead of \,
		and a mount point if necessary (e.g., /disks/d/pvm3_4_0)

7-	Add the directory containing the CYGWIN1.DLL file to the system PATH
	variable. If the path already includes some directory containing POSIX
	utilities from the NT resource kit, the directory containing the 
	CYGWIN1.DLL file must be inserted before the one containing POSIX
	utilities.

8-	If the locations chosen for /tmp and /etc are not direct subdirectories
	of C:\ or if the PVM root directory is not on the C: drive, you must 
	create permanent mount points for them. In the registry editor, go to 
	the key:

\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Cygnus Solutions\CYGWIN.DLL.setup\b15.0\mounts

	and, for each of the needed mount points, select the first empty 
	subkey and add the following values:

fbinary (REG_DWORD) 0
fsilent (REG_DWORD) 0
native (REG_SZ) windows path (e.g., C:\TEMP)
unix (REG_SZ) unix path (e.g., /tmp)

	This may require administraive privileges under NT.

9-	Reboot the system.
