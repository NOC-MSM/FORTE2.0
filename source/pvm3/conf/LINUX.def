# Notes on readline Usage:
#
#	If your Linux system has readline, then you may append the
#	following flags to the defines below:
#
#		ARCHCFLAGS = . . .  -DHASREADLINE
#		ARCHLIB = . . .  -lreadline
#
#	and recompile PVM.
#
#	On some Linux systems, readline requires ncurses, so you
#	must also add "-lncurses" to the ARCHLIB define.
#
# For building shared libraries, swap the SHAREDCFLAGS define below
#	to use the -fpic (or -fPIC, usually equivalent) setting,
#   (be sure $(SHAREDCFLAGS) is included in $(ARCHCFLAGS) below)
#	and then do a "make clean ; make shared" in $PVM_ROOT.
#
# SHAREDCFLAGS = -fpic
SHAREDCFLAGS =
SHAREDLDFLAGS = -shared
