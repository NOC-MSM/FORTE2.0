# Notes on readline Usage:
#
#	If your Linux system has readline, then you may append the
#	following flags to the defines below:
#
#		ARCHCFLAGS = . . .  -DHASREADLINE
#		ARCHLIB = . . .  -lreadline
#
#	and recompile PVM.
#
#	On some Linux systems, readline requires ncurses, so you
#	must also add "-lncurses" to the ARCHLIB define.
#
# Add define of HASSTDLIB for LINUX64 (copied from the LINUX template) 
# new definitions to allow, at least, "malloc.h" heder file include
# and thus not generate 32-bits truncating (thru "sxt4" assembly
# instruction ...) code, leading to Linux64 Virtual Memory addresses
# to be corrupted ("segments" bits are located in the highest weighted
# word/bits !!), on IA-64/Linux64 platforms.
#
# For some x86-64 systems (like LINUXX86_64 on Fedora 5), you need
# to add -DSYSVSTR to ARCHCFLAGS, or else strerror() will bomb.
# (Thanks to Bill Schell <bill@skarven.net> for this report!)
#
# For building shared libraries, swap the SHAREDCFLAGS define below
#	to use the -fpic (or -fPIC, usually equivalent) setting,
#   (be sure $(SHAREDCFLAGS) is included in $(ARCHCFLAGS) below)
#	and then do a "make clean ; make shared" in $PVM_ROOT.
#
# SHAREDCFLAGS = -fpic
SHAREDCFLAGS =
SHAREDLDFLAGS = -shared
