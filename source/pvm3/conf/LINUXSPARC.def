# Notes on readline Usage:
#
#	If your Linux system has readline, then you may append the
#	following flags to the defines below:
#
#		ARCHCFLAGS = . . .  -DHASREADLINE
#		ARCHLIB = . . .  -lreadline
#
#	and recompile PVM.
#
#	On some Linux systems, readline requires ncurses, so you
#	must also add "-lncurses" to the ARCHLIB define.
#
