#
#	Make wrapper for multiple arch. builds.
#
#	Automatically sets PVM_ARCH for $MAKE to use.
#
#	Action depends on makefile locations:
#	1.  If $PVM_ARCH/Makefile or $PVM_ARCH/makefile exists,
#		chdir to $PVM_ARCH and exec $MAKE there.
#
#	2.  Else if ./Makefile.aimk exists,
#		chdir to $PVM_ARCH and exec $MAKE
#		with -f $PVM_ROOT/conf/$PVM_ARCH.def
#		and -f $AIMK_SRC/Makefile.aimk PVM_ARCH=$PVM_ARCH
#		$AIMK_SRC is the original working directory before the chdir.
#
#	3.  Else will simply exec $MAKE in cwd.
#
#	usage:
#	    aimk [-here] [ make args ... ]
