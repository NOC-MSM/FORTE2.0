PVM version 3.4 Bug Report Form
02 February 2009
________________________________________________________________________

If you find a bug in PVM, please report it to:

    pvm@msr.csm.ornl.gov
________________________________________________________________________

Please try to include the following information:

* The exact version and patch level of PVM you're using (e.g. 3.4.0).
  This is necessary, because we don't want to go looking through source
  for all past versions of PVM.  Also, if you're using an old version,
  you mave have found a bug that we've already fixed.

* The machine type(s) you're using, hardware and software (e.g. DEC
  3000/500 running OSF 1.2).  This is helpful if we want to try to
  reproduce the bug here.  Also, we know very little about some of the
  machines PVM runs on and we'll be able to tell you that.

* The machine architecture PVM chooses for you (e.g. ALPHA).

* What shell you use (csh, ksh, ...).

* A short description of the problem (what happens, when it happens,
  what you did, etc.).  Include any relevant input you typed and output
  printed by PVM.  Don't edit the output to format it or summarize it
  (except maybe for removing 10000 lines that say the same thing - make
  a note you did this).  Crucial information about the bug may be in a
  few numbers or words.

* Please warn us if you've made any changes to the distribution source.
