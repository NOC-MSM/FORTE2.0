________________________________________________________________________

This directory contains a bunch of random PVM-related programs and
utilities.  They're here because they might be generally useful, but
I don't want to kill myself supporting them.  Like the "examples",
even less official.

pvm_fork.c

 This is an implementation of pvm_fork(), a function to fork a new PVM
 task from an existing PVM task.

xhoster/

 This is a little X-Windows program that enrolls as the hoster task,
 giving the user a convenient place to type passwords when starting
 hosts that require them.

group-hack-337

 This is a patch to PVM version 3.3.7 to allow access to the virtual
 machine to anyone in a unix group.  If environment variable PVM_GID
 is set to the name or number of a group, sockets and files are
 chown'd to that group and mode 0660 is used instead of 0600.

 Note that all spawned processes have the same user id as the pvmd,
 so this isn't a true multi-user virtual machine.  This is seen as
 being useful mainly for allowing e.g. a group of people access to
 a database, or display or instrument server.
