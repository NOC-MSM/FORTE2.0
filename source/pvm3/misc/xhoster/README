Xhoster
09 Oct 1995

________________________________________________________________________

This is a little X-Windows program that enrolls as the hoster task,
giving the user a convenient place to type passwords when starting
hosts that require them.  It also logs problems related to startup,
for help in debugging.

To build it, type "xmkmf" then "aimk" in this directory, and install
it wherever you want, f.e. $PVM_ROOT/lib/$PVM_ARCH/xhoster.

Suggested X defaults to make it look less ugly would be:

    xhoster*background: antiquewhite3
    xhoster*font: -*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--14-100-*-*-p-*-*-*
    xhoster.geometry: 700x300

The xhoster can be attached and detached without shutting down the
pvmds.

The hoster protocols have changed enough in PVM 3.4.2 that this
xhoster no longer works.  Consider this source code a template
for constructing a X-Windows hoster program, and refer to the
text-based hoster in pvm3/hoster for assiatance in constructing
your own hoster.

All the Best,
