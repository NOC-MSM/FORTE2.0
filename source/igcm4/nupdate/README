3)
In defn.h, increase max_comdecks from 1500 to 2000 to stop bus error
on the SGI.

----------------------------

4)
In defn.h increase both max_decks and max_comdecks to 3000 to stop
memory fault in mklib for um vn4.5.

Anette Van der Wal - 07/09/98

----------------------------

5)
In mklib.c, added #ifdef SAVELOG around the following lines from create_library:

        fprintf( logfile, "\n%d comdecks processed", cdkname_no  );
        fprintf( logfile, "\n%d decks processed\n", dkname_no  );

as it was producing a memory fault if compiled without -DSAVE_LOG, since the
log file was not open in this case.
