Compile the oasis-aux-files making program with 'f77 progs/*.f'. To run, ensure
you have the igcm map you want copied to t42.59 in this directory, and run the
executable you just made.

changing resolution: you need to alter the parameters.h file in progs/ thus:

if you've changed the MOMA resolution to 2 degrees, you can just sub-in the
parameters.h.2x2 file into parameters.h. Otherwise...

nxo needs to be the same as the number you changed '90' to in moma/param.h. nyo
needs to be what you changed the '43' to, +2. yoffs needs to be the same as
latmin from ocean.in, minus (dydeg/2). xoffs is 0 + (dxdeg/2). dyo and dxo are
the same as dydeg and dxdeg
