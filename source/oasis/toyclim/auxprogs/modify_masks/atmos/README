Use files in this directory to create a new atmos land mask

Procedure is described in ../ocean/README - with slight differences, i.e,
programs are readmap and writemap.f and the output goes to fort.3 (human) and
fort.31 (ferret) files and the input file is t42.59.??

Also, programs called addorog.f, readorog.f and writeorog.f allow 
the orography from the original file to be written into the new map.
The new orography can then be manually corrected to include/remove 
new land/sea points.
