=============================================================================
To modify the land mask to your liking do the following:

1) First compile the files to reformat the moma-formatted land mask
   ifort -o readkmtc readkmtc.f
   ifort -o writekmtc writekmtc.f

2) You need a copy of the original land mask to get started -
   call it ocean.kmtc.test00

3) Run readkmtc and input 00 at the prompt (creates files fort.17 fort.18 and fort.19)
   fort.19 is a ferret-readable version of the landmask from ocean.kmtc.test00
   fort.17 and fort.18 are human-readable versions of the landmask from ocean.kmtc.test00

4) Run ferret and type in "go omask" at the prompt
   omask.jnl is a ferret script which takes the fort.19 data and plots it along
   with the "real" coastline. You can look at the plot and decide which gridpoints
   need changing.

5) Edit fort.17 and/or fort.18 to create the desired effect.

6) Run writekmtc entering 01 at the prompt
   (creates file ocean.kmtc.test01)

7) Run readkmtc again (enter 01 at the prompt) - 
   overwrites fort.17, 18 and 19.

8) Run ferret and type in "go omask" at the prompt to see a plot of the changes

Now go back to step 5 and iterate until satisfied remembering to increment the
version number (01 in steps 5 to 7 above) each time


Bathymetry from the old mask can be added to the new mask using bathkmtc.f.

Use bathread.f and bathwrite.f in the same iterative process as above (steps 5
-7) to adjust the bathymetry to suit the new mask.
